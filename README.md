### README: Tomato Quality Classification Using CNN and Attention Mechanism

---

#### **Overview**

This project addresses the challenge of assessing tomato quality using deep learning, focusing on classifying tomatoes into four categories: **Ripe**, **Unripe**, **Old**, and **Damaged**. By employing **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)** with an integrated **attention mechanism**, the system automatically extracts features and improves classification accuracy by emphasizing critical image regions.

---

#### **Key Features**
- **Automated Tomato Quality Assessment**: Classifies tomatoes into four categories, enhancing sorting and grading efficiency.
- **Attention Mechanism**: Helps the model focus on important image regions, such as spots or color gradients.
- **Robust Workflow**: Includes preprocessing steps like image resizing, scaling, and augmentation to improve model generalization.
- **Metrics for Evaluation**: Uses accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to validate model performance.

#### **Dataset**
- **Size**: 7226 images categorized into four classes: Ripe, Unripe, Old, and Damaged.
- **Split Ratio**: 90% for training, 10% for validation.
- **Important Features**:
  - **Color**
  - **Texture**
  - **Shape**

#### **Workflow**
1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Image resizing to \(150 \times 150\).
   - Scaling pixel values.
   - Augmentation to increase dataset variability.

2. **Model Design**:
   - **Input Layer**: Accepts images of size \(150 \times 150 \times 3\) (RGB).
   - **Convolutional Layers**: Extracts hierarchical features.
     - Layer 1: Detects edges and textures.
     - Layer 2: Recognizes shapes and object parts.
     - Layer 3: Captures abstract structural features.
   - **Attention Mechanism**: Focuses on relevant image regions.
   - **Dense Layers**: Combines extracted features for classification.

3. **Model Training and Evaluation**:
   - Trained on a labeled dataset using CNN with an attention layer.
   - Metrics: Accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

4. **Deployment**:
   - Automates the tomato quality assessment process for real-world applications.

#### **Proposed Model Architecture**

1. **Input Layer**:
   - Input: \(150 \times 150 \times 3\) RGB images.

2. **Convolutional Layers**:
   - Layer 1: 32 filters (\(3 \times 3\)), ReLU activation, MaxPooling.
   - Layer 2: 64 filters (\(3 \times 3\)), ReLU activation, MaxPooling.
   - Layer 3: 128 filters (\(3 \times 3\)), ReLU activation, MaxPooling.

3. **Attention Mechanism**:
   - Attention Map: Highlights critical regions using a \(1 \times 1\) convolutional layer with sigmoid activation.
   - Multiplication: Emphasizes important features by multiplying the attention map with the final feature map.

4. **Flatten Layer**:
   - Converts multi-dimensional feature maps to a one-dimensional vector.

5. **Fully Connected Layers**:
   - Dense Layer: 512 neurons, ReLU activation.
   - Output Layer: 4 neurons, softmax activation (for Ripe, Unripe, Old, Damaged categories).
